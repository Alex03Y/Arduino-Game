## Arduino-Game

This project I created to illustrate the ideas in the defense of a master's degree.

It is an addition to the final part of the presentation (demo version).
You can interact with this game through bluetooth using the controller in the form of a spirometer,
which I made on the basis of Arduino.

### Project idea

Creation of a platform for medical examinations, where the game itself would control the examination process.
